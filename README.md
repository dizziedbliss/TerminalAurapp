- **Voice Commands**: Integrate speech recognition to make the assistant respond to voice commands.
- **Music Library**: Allow users to select songs from their music library instead of a predefined track.
- **News Sources**: Integrate more RSS feeds or provide options for users to choose from different categories (e.g., tech, sports, etc.).
- **Persistent Data**: Implement a way to store user preferences, such as the preferred city for weather, or favorite music, across sessions.
